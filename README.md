# cloneacademy

Welcome to cloneacademy! 

Cloneacademy is a tutorial series where you can learn and improve software development skills throught building clone applications. Why clone applications? Well, one of the best ways to learn is to built. So why not take a stab at building a real world production application with all the bells and whistles? The best part: you don't have to worry about coming up with an idea! Plus many of these applications have complex features and concepts that are difficult to find elsewhere. Convinced? Great! Let's see what we're in for.

A goal for this series is to build these applicaitons in a way that is reflective of real world development (mostly). Each project will be full stack and not limited to one langauge. The primary langagues I use for development are: Golang, Javascript (Node and React), Scala, and Swift. However, feel free to follow along in your favorite language of choice. I've written each tutorial to focus primarily on design decisions and concepts. You should be able to translate these to any language of your choosing. Each tutorial consists of these components:

1. Technology Overview: 
2. Architecture Overview: 
3. Task Board: agile tasks for tracking work.
4. Writen tutorial for building each component.
5. Resources: souce code, links, slack channel/community forum.

Before jumping in I would like to provide a small disclaimer. I am still very much learning myself and by no means am I an expert at many (if any) of these tools and technologies. That being said, I am open to any and all feedback and contributions! If you have any suggestions, corrections, or questions please do not hesitate to provide your input as it would be much appriciated. I would love for this to be a resource that continues to grow and improve as we do and it will only get better with your help!
